(1, 'OLIVIA', '"This domestic thriller centers around Millie, the main character, who secures a job as a maid for the affluent Winchester family. Hired on the spot by Nina, the wife, Millie, moves into their mansion, living in the attic bedroom. For Millie, who is homeless, this job signifies a fresh start.  However, Millie harbors secrets of her own — secrets that the Winchesters are unaware of, including her recent release from jail. As tensions escalate and the family’s hidden truths emerge and no one is safe."I found The Housemaid a little boring. I did not find The Housemaid to be “addictive psychological thriller”. Rather, it is an entangled mess of psychotic characters.There is not a lot of character development. the author cleverly disguises the actual events. But, the first half of the book goes on and on over the same territory - Millie dislikes Nina and has fantasies of winning her husband. Nina goes thur some unstable emotion. The middle of the story is Nina’s version of the same situation from her point of view. Lots of repeated information. It gets to the point of OK, I get it already! the surprises begin to occur at the end, and things get more interesting. But, by then, you almost do not care anymore and just want to be done the book.', 3, false),
(1, 'LIAM', 'Brace yourself, because ''The Housemaid'' is a novel that will keep you glued to the pages from start to finish, constantly questioning everything you think you know. Just when you believe you''ve unraveled the twisted narrative, author Freida McFadden pulls the rug out from under you, leaving you breathless and craving more. This book is a true masterclass in psychological suspense that demands to be devoured in a single, uninterrupted sitting.From the opening chapters, McFadden weaves an intricate web of mystery and deceit, introducing readers to a cast of complex characters and a seemingly idyllic suburban setting that harbors dark secrets beneath its pristine veneer. The story''s central figure, the enigmatic housemaid Millie, is a captivating presence, her motivations and allegiances constantly shifting, keeping you guessing about her true nature until the very end.As the plot unfolds, the tension ratchets up with each turn of the page, as McFadden deftly plants seeds of doubt and suspicion, forcing you to question the reliability of every character''s perspective. Just when you think you''ve pieced together the puzzle, she expertly upends your assumptions, leaving you reeling and eagerly devouring the next twist or revelation.What truly sets ''The Housemaid'' apart, however, is its ability to not only shock and surprise but also to delve into the depths of human psychology and the complexities of familial relationships. McFadden''s exploration of themes such as trust, loyalty, and the lengths to which people will go to protect their loved ones adds a compelling emotional layer to the narrative, making the characters and their plights resonate long after the final page.From the meticulously crafted plot to the richly developed characters and the haunting atmospheric backdrop, every element of ''The Housemaid'' is a testament to McFadden''s skill as a writer.

Do yourself a favor and clear your schedule before diving into ''The Housemaid'' – because once you start, you won''t be able to put it down until the jaw-dropping conclusion.', 5, true),
(2, 'OLIVIA', 'We have several of the Gravity Falls journals and they are usually filled with cutesy and clever graphics. Yes, the show can be scary but they always do it in a cartoony way similar to Scooby Doo. This book is not that way! It is very dark and almost satanic and mythical. Not for young readers.', 1, false),
(2, 'LIAM', 'As much as I love Gravity Falls and especially Bill as a whole, I was a little disappointed in the lack of additions to the story, universe, and plot line as a whole. Alex Hirsch has a fantastic grip on who Bill is as a character, and this book 100% feels written and told by the demon himself. I would absolutely recommend this to any die hard Gravity Falls fan as a collectible, but not so much as a book.', 3, false),
(2, 'EMMA', 'Wasn''t a fan...', 1, false),
(4, 'OLIVIA', 'It Ends With Us is an emotional hurricane that picks up speed and force as it goes along. The heartache and pain that is entangled with the love and hope had my heart racing! This story is honest, raw and powerful. She had two amazing friendships in this story that I am grateful for. One since she was young and one as an adult. Both just wanted her to be happy and chase her. One wanted to protect her but also not push her away while she came to her own realizations. The other didn’t sugarcoat and I even shouted out when her best friend knew the truth and said what she said! (Keep it spoiler free) The choices Lily made were thought provoking and I just wanted to reach inside the story and pull her out to a safe place but that isn’t the reality that a lot of people live. The strength it takes to live everyday with the unknown and survive shows the resiliency people have. I believe Colleen wrote this as a way of opening people’s eyes to both sides when people are quick to judge and as a way to heal. It steals your breath, tugs on your heart and just fills you with hope and love for a brighter, happier future that ends with us!', 4, false),
(4, 'LIAM', 'What I dislike most about this novel is that with all the amazing authors and stories out there, this drivel is considered a New York Times best seller and the book is getting so much promotion. This is the third time I have taken a TikTok recommendation for a best seller, and all three times the books were just nonsense and not worthy of the money and praise they are getting. There may be some spoilers ahead, so continue with caution. This book is so cliche, the characters are undeveloped, and I felt embarrassed having to read it. I finished it so that I could write an honest review, but it was torture trying to finish this book. I even took a break from it to read another book, and having come back to it from another book, I realized just how terribly written it is! The main character is your typical, "she is so pretty she doesn''t know it." Two men fall madly in love with her, and she is great at everything she does, including playing poker and bonding with strange men. Everything just somehow works out perfectly for all three characters to their looks, careers, and successes. The ''Naked Truths'' were cute in the first couple of chapters, but if you and your partner can only be honest with each other after saying, Naked Truths?" then that is a red flag for a toxic relationship. There is no character development, except if you count that the whole first part of the book, the character is one way, and then on page 303 suddenly becomes this strong willed character who is finally making sense and contradicts what she said earlier in the novel. Hoover and another reviewer said that it was hard to read about Ryle''s temper because they loved his personality in the beginning; what personality?! He is not ambitious; he is pompous. There''s not much to him except the typical white handsome rich guy who begs for sex. There were lame excuses throughout the novel to explain things away, such as Ryle makes a trusting father because some abusive men are only abusive toward their spouses, or Lily got pregnant because she skipped a couple of her birth control pills. I know that is possible, but why even throw that in there? Oddly enough, I enjoyed the ending. I thought that it had a good theme, but I prefer books where the theme is intertwined throughout the novel and isn''t just dumped on the reader in the last couple of pages. The epilogue, however, ruined the only saving grace of this novel and made sure to end up like a badly written Hallmark movie. Somehow everything gets tied up in a nice little bow for everyone including Ryle. In the Author''s note, Hoover explains that she is writing from experience. It just goes to show that you can have a good story to tell and not the ability to actually write. Not only is this not a good story or book, but the author just can''t write. She writes about as well as some of my struggling 8th graders. I had already knew that this book was about abuse, so I went into it thinking it was going to tackle a mature subject matter, but this book is neither mature or even dark. The author says that she wrote it so that people can understand why a woman would stay with an abuser, but this book did not do that for me. I will admit that I am a person who does not understand how a woman gets involved with an abuser or chooses to stay, and rather than coming away from this book with more understanding of that situation, I came away with the thought that the author took a serious subject matter and profited off it without doing any serious work. This is not a cheesy romance novel, this is worse. As one reviewer said, if you take your books seriously, skip this crap. I can only think that the reason this book is getting so much praise is because of a good publisher and teenagers and middle aged women who either never had good sex or have a misunderstanding of love and sex. The dialogue is cringy and the book is predictable. Hoover, you just can''t write or tell a story.', 1, false),
(4, 'EMMA', 'WOW! Just… wow! This has got to be the BEST book Colleen Hoover has written to date. The stark honesty and impacting nature of this story will punch you in the feels. Hard. I''ve never experienced an abuse story to quite this level. I was blown away by this story and left a babbling ball of nerves and tears. A book hasn''t touched me this deeply in quite some time. I also learned quite a bit from this story. We''re always so quick to judge in instances of abuse… but there''s so much more to the story than you see with the naked eye. Don''t judge. Don''t assume facts that aren''t true. And, most importantly, don''t ever think it can''t happen to you or someone you know. Such a strong story that is sure to impact every reader that opens the cover in one way or another. I''m leave completely blown away by this story, as well as hopeful, which is such a wonderful thing. Colleen, you''ve done it AGAIN!', 5, true),
(4, 'NOAH', 'It Ends With Us was beautifully complicated. It was hot and cold. Up and down. Good and bad. Beautiful and ugly... I''m still trying to figure out how I really feel about it all because I''m genuinely torn on how I want to perceive this storyline. I loved it but in all honesty, I really do think I hate it as well. Not the "I-hate-you-Colleen-Hoover-stop-writing-books-and-find-a-different-career" type of hate but rather "I-hate-you-Colleen-Hoover-for-making-me-hate-everything-that-I-came-to-love" kind of hate because it pretty much summarizes all my thoughts and feelings about It Ends With Us in one sentence.', 4, true),
(4, 'AVA', 'I liked the characters, in general. I liked the story, in general. I love how Lily''s journal is "letters" to Ellen. I do like Lily''s growth through out. I did not care for Ryle''s (dumb book name) character growth. He basically gets away with it. Also, I expected adult Atlas to be in this WAY more.', 3, false),
(6, 'OLIVIA', 'I don''t normally read romance novels, and wouldn''t have read this one except for a recommendation from someone & the many fantastic reviews. I read it on Kindle, so didn''t get fooled by the Russian helicopter on the cover (WHAT??)- was this some kind of metaphor for the US having lost the war? I actually enjoyed the portion of the book when Frankie was serving in Nam (although the drama in how she got there was more than a small stretch). It''s clear she researched (borrowed? plagiarised with consent?) many of the daily routines that our "heroine" experienced. I could swallow the almost love affair & later consummated love affair as spice to the story of Army nurses in Nam. BUT, as soon as she landed back in Coronado, the novel began to fall apart in a million ways. SPOILER ALERT:::::::::The copious examples of being condemned by mere bystanders was unrealistic overkill. The scenes with her parents got repetitive & I began skipping pages. The efforts to get help that she gave up on were redundant (too much "There were no women in Vietnam"- we got the point after the second time). Her relationship with Henry, her mother''s stroke & her non-profit for women vets in Montana granted some redemptive power to her story. BUT, TWO MEN KIA THEN BACK FROM THE DEAD - just to make the point that Frankie could never move on from Vietnam? The worst, of course, was the ending. I was so angry I felt like throwing my Kindle into something I could break! Just NO NO NO. Not in a million years would I have imagined that she would end it so ridiculously - I felt I had taken my granddaughter to see the most recent & predictably trite Walt Disney fairy tail of unbelievable life. I will never read another of this author''s books. (Serves me right, I guess. There''s a reason I don''t read romance novels)', 1, false),
(6, 'LIAM', 'America has always portrayed itself as a country of advanced thinking, but the truth under its boasting is that , for the most part, if women were a reason to be proud, America ignored them. Hannah reveals this "critical gender theory" in her book about a nurse serving in Vietnam. Her main character is Frankie McGrath , a young woman who becomes an Army nurse in Vietnam. She believes she should serve her country in some way after her brother is killed in the war shortly after he enlists. She is hoping her mother and most importantly, her father will be proud of her. She gets the exact opposite reaction. They expected her to get married and have children. Her father has a "hero''s wall" of family members who served in past wars. She can only be on that wall after she gets married, and the picture is her wedding picture, and it will be the only picture of her. The wall is symbolic of what society deemed was heroic and only men could be heroic in that way. There was only room for a woman if she married, became a housewife, and had children. While this choice is perfectly acceptable, it should not be perfectly binding as the only way for a woman to show her worth. Frankie is sure she belongs on that wall as a nurse who serves in the Army. Her parents disagree and tell their friends , when Frankie goes off to the war, thst she is studying abroad. But it isn''t just her family whose narrow vision of Frankie affects her life. The Army itself has allowed societal rules to dictate how women are treated. Getting to Vietnam is no picnic for Frankie. While her fellow travelers are all men dressed in comfortable fatigues, she must travel in her blouse, tight green jacket, narrow, skirt, nylons held up by a regulation girdle (despite panty hose being available) , and heels. The life of a nurse in a war zone is dangerous, frightening, and traumatic. The war makes less and less sense to Frankie as she stuffs vital organs back into shredded chests and abdominal cavities, and helps doctors amputate more than one limb per patient. Frankie comes to realize with growing horror what is really going on in Vietnam, that America was losing that war, but didn''t mind sacrificing more and more young men so that the government could save face. It is a rude awakening for her. When she returns home after two tours of duty, she is treated with disrespect by the public, the VA, and her parents. The country had been told that no women went to Vietnam, so Frankie could not have been there even though she so obviously was. That has always been the problem with woman who don''t follow the rules society dictates. If they insist on showing how wrong headed that thinking is, society will just have to minimize them if not ignore them. Suffering from what is now recognized as PTSD, Frankie hits rock bottom before she is able, with the help of her nurse friends who also served, to find a way to survive. The Vietnam protests by the veterans themselves as well as everyone else who raised their voices, finally ended the war. Eventually, the government admitted that over 6,000 nurses,most of them women, served in Vietnam. Hannah''s story is thoroughly researched. Her depiction of war torn Vietnam is riveting. One turns the pages to end the war as soon as possible. Frankie''s struggles with the war and at home are realistic, heartbreaking, and deeply troubling, but they don''t destroy her. She survived Vietnam, and she survives coming back home.', 4, false),
